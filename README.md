# overtone-columbus-clojure

Code from my Overtone presentation for the Columbus Clojure user group. 

## Usage

See the [Overtone github page](https://github.com/overtone/overtone) for more information on Overtone.

Running `lein repl` in this project should get a REPL that is equipped with Overtone, so hack away.

During the talk, I used Vim with a REPL plugin for quick evaluation of the code examples. My Vim setup uses `vim-surround`, `vim-clojure-static`, and `vim-fireplace`. I'll add links to those at some point.

If you use any of this code, it would be a cool guy move to put my name and a link to this repo in a comment somewhere. I have no interest in enforcing this though, so your attribution of the original author of this code is only effected by your own personal code of ethics.
